## Summary

Upon completion on analysis, a target bike riding audience is high lighted, peak times of use and location where most rides occur. Based on trends derived from the Citibike data in NYC, men tend to be the most frequent bike riders when compared across all genders. Bike riders tend to ride bikes during peak commute hours which happen to fall during the weekday. The peak hours remain similar across the genders and weekdays. Men lead the total number of membership based rides in the NYC Citibike data. Majority of rides take place in the center of the city, where population tends to be more dense. Bike rides are a great option for busy cities and allow for an easier commute between destinations. Des Moines, Iowa is a great contender the shared-bike program. The business proposal should focus on targeting male clients in the center of the city, where bike commutes are short and can bikes can be found with ease. Based on the analysis completed peak hours should mirror those of NYC as commute hours tend to be similar within the city center radius. Two additional visualizations one could perform in order to aid with this analysis is to gather the population density inside Des Moines city limits and analyze the gender composition of the population.
